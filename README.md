# Yolov5-DeepSort-MOT

Implementing YOLOv5-DeepSort for Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) involves integrating YOLOv5 for object detection and DeepSort for object tracking. This combination enables tracking multiple objects across frames in a video sequence. Below, I'll provide a high-level overview of the steps involved:

    Object Detection (YOLOv5):
        YOLOv5 is used to detect objects in each frame of the video.
        It provides bounding boxes and class probabilities for each detected object.

    Object Tracking (DeepSort):
        DeepSort is applied to track objects across frames.
        It associates detections from consecutive frames by considering their appearance features and spatial locations.
        DeepSort maintains a set of tracked objects, associating detections with existing tracks or creating new tracks as necessary.

    Integration:
        After obtaining object detections from YOLOv5, feed these detections into the DeepSort tracker.
        DeepSort updates its internal state and returns the IDs of tracked objects along with their bounding boxes in each frame.

    Post-processing
        Perform any post-processing steps such as filtering out low-confidence detections, smoothing trajectories, or handling occlusions.
